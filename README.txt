About: 

This project is for the Intro to Backend section of Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. 

- The main.py file has the routing information for each of the handlers. This is the main file from which the program is run.  
  It imports from handlers and models.

- text.py contains information used in hashing passwords.

- The handlers folder contains the classes which control the views. 

- The models folder contains files for each Google Datastore kind (has similarities to "table" in SQL).

- The app.yaml file contains the configuration for the application and includes the static directories for the images and css in the file.

- index.yaml is autogenerated on deployment by dev_appserver for the admin console.

- The templates folder holds the html pages for the program. Jinja2 templating language is used in both main.py and the templates.

- The css folder contains the style.css file which handles the design of all the pages in the templates folder

- The images folder holds the images used in the html and css.
